I collected data from specific sensors that measure the intensity of the nervous impulse when smelling a particular smell, I did the research process, collected the values, and built my own data set for four scents, with it worth mentioning that I can collect more data and develop the algorithms that I used in this project to be able to classify 250 different smells.",
